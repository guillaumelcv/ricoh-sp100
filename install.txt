First of all, you bought wrong printer :) This "driver" is not in
production state. It was only an experiment.

So, installation procedure:

1)  Open terminal, execute 'check-requirements' script. It will check
    whether all required packages are installed and available or not.

2)  Install missing packages.

3)  Copy 'pstoricohddst-gdi' to CUPS filters directory (usually
    /usr/lib/cups/filter).

4)  Make sure that it's executable and owned by root:root
    (i.e. chown root:root pstoricohddst-gdi).

5)  Make sure the printer is connected to the computer and turned on,
    then configure it with CUPS Web Interface: open your browser, type
    'localhost:631', go to 'Administration' > 'Add Printer'. Find your
    printer and choose it, then press 'Continue'. After that, provide a
    PPD file with the name of your printer from 'ppd' folder. Finally,
    press 'Add Printer', then 'Set Default Options'.

6)  As you finish step 5, go to the 'Printers' tab, choose your printer.
    Click 'Maintenance'. In the list choose 'Print test page'. If the
    printer is printing and the page is not blank, you configured
    it correctly.

7)  If your printer does not print after the first job, then you need to
    reset the USB port the printer is connected to. In terminal, go into
    the project directory and execute 'sudo ./resetusb_script'. Then try
    to run the job again.
